EverCart is a Bukkit plugin that tracks when a storage cart is moving and will load up chunks to keep it
moving along the tracks in an area that no players are around to keep it loaded so it will go really long
distances without the need of players constantly around it. This is especially helpful in RP servers that
have different towns that are very far apart and need to send supplies back and forth without forcing two
players to meet up and trade.
